Exercise 2.11: Vectorised function
Let  𝐴33  be the two-dimensional array

𝐀33=0−11112−15−1−15
 
Implement and apply the function

𝑓(𝑥)=𝑥3+𝑥𝑒𝑥+1
 
to each element in  𝐴33 . Then calculate the result of the array expression  𝐴333+𝐴33𝑒𝐴33+1 , and demonstrate that the end result of the two methods are the same.


# Uncomment and complete this code - keep the names the same for testing purposes.
