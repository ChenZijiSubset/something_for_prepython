Exercise 2.2: Make a table (a list of lists) of function values
Write a loop that evaluates the expression  𝑦(𝑡)=𝑣0𝑡−12𝑔𝑡2  for 11 evenly spaced  𝑡  values ranging from  0 , to  2𝑣0/𝑔  (remember that dividing a range into  𝑛  intervals results in  𝑛+1  values). You can assume that  𝑣0=1 ms −1  and  𝑔=9.81 ms −2 .
Store the time values and displacement ( 𝑦 ) values as a nested list, i.e.
tlist = [t0, t1, t2, ...]
ylist = [y0, y1, y2, ...]
displacement = [tlist, ylist]
Use the variable names tlist, ylist and displacement as illustrated in the above example for testing purposes.

# Uncomment and modify the following lines. Do not change variable names for testing purposes.
def y(v0, tlist):
    y = []
    for i in range(len(tlist)):
        g = 9.81
        tmp = v0 * tlist[i] - 0.5 * g * tlist[i]**2
        y.append(tmp)
    return y

v0 = 1
g = 9.81

t = 0
tlist = []
for i in range(0, 11):
    tlist.append(t)
    t = t + 2 * v0 / (10 * g)

ylist = y(v0, tlist)

displacement = [tlist, ylist]

with pybryt.check(pybryt_reference(2, 2)):
    tlist, ylist, displacement

MESSAGES:
  - SUCCESS: You generated tlist correctly. Great!
  - ERROR: Your ylist is wrong.
  - ERROR: Hmm... It seems your nested displacement list is wrong.
