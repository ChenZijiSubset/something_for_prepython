Exercise 1.19: Calculate  𝜋 
A formula for  𝜋  is given by the Gregory-Leibniz series:

𝜋=4(11−13+15−17+19+...)
 
Note that the denominators of the terms in this series are the positive odd numbers. Write a Python function calculate_pi(n) following the guidelines below; each of the first three steps can be completed using a single list comprehension.

Step 1:

Produce a list of the first n odd numbers, for n=100.

Step 2:

Make a list of the signs of each term, i.e. [1, -1, 1, -1, ...]. Hint: think about the value of  (−1)𝑖  for integer  𝑖 .

Step 3:

Using the results of steps 1 and 2, make a list of the first n terms in the above series.

Step 4:

Use your my_sum function to sum this series, multiply by 4, and return the result.、

def calculate_pi(n):
    l = []
    tmp = []
    r = []
    j = -1
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        ll = 2 * i - 1
        l.append(ll)
        t = j**(i + 1)
        tmp.append(t)

    for i in range(0, n - 1):
        rr = (1/l[i]) * tmp[i]
        r.append(rr)
        
    return 4 * my_sum(r)
calculate_pi(100)
