Exercise 1.15: Implement the sum function
The built-in Python function sum takes a list as an argument and computes the sum of the elements in the list:

>> sum([1, 3, 5, -5])
4
Implement your own version of the sum function and name it my_sum.

# Uncomment and complete this code - keep the names the same for testing purposes.

def my_sum(x):
    s = 0
    i = 0
    while(i < len(x)):
        s = s + x[i]
        i = i + 1
    return s

SATISFIED: False
MESSAGES:
  - SUCCESS: Great! In each iteration, you are adding a list element to the sum variable.
  - ERROR: You are not iterating over the list elements.
  - SUCCESS: Before the loop, you set the sum to be zero. Well done!
  - SUCCESS: Your function returns the correct solution.
