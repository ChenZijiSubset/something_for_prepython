Exercise 4.1: Make a dictionary from a table
The file data/constants.txt contains a table of the values and the dimensions of some fundamental constants from physics. We want to load this table into a dictionary constants, where the keys are the names of the constants. For example, constants["gravitational constant"] holds the value of the gravitational constant (6.67259  ×10−11 ) in Newton's law of gravitation. Make a function read_constants(file_path) that reads and interprets the text in the file passed as an argument, and after that returns the dictionary.

# Uncomment and modify the following code. Do not change variable names for testing purposes.

def read_constants(file_path):
    constants = {}
    with open(file_path, "r") as fr:
        for lines in fr:
            print(lines)
            if lines[0] != 'n' and lines[0] != '-': 
                words = lines.split('  ')
                constants[words[0]] = float(lines[24:44])
    return constants
#     ...

MESSAGES:
  - SUCCESS: Amazing! You are extracting constants and adding them as items to the dictionary.
  - SUCCESS: Great! You are iterating through the file line by line.
  - SUCCESS: You start with an empty dictionary before the loop. Well done!
  - ERROR: You do not split lines into fragments
  - SUCCESS: Wow! Your resulting dictionary is correct.
